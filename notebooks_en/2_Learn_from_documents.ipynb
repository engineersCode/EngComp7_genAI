    "# Using Jupyter AI with your documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs generated by a language model can include inaccuracies, particularly when you ask about new or specialized material that was absent from the training data. Generated code can also be incorrect, so you of course have to review and test any code suggestions offered by your AI assistant. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get more reliable outputs from a language model, you can combine the generation model with a retrieval model and use external sources of information. This is called _Retrieval Augmented Generation_, RAG, and it allows the LLM to generate content that is _grounded_ by the documents processed with the retrieval model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A retrieval model can find relevant information in your collection of documents by using _embeddings_, that is, representations of the words and sentences in the documents on a numeric vector space. Embeddings are able to encode meaning, and capture semantic similarity via distances of vectors in the mapped space. Moving from text data to vector spaces brings the great power of linear algebra to the task!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set an embedding model to use with Jupyter AI in the settings (gear icon on the chat interface). For example, I am using `text-embedding-ada-002`, the [Open AI embedding model](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model).\n",

    "The Jupyter AI [documentation](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/index.html#learning-about-local-data) does not mention the types of files that can be used with the `/learn` command. But on exploring the source code, I found a [line](https://github.com/ellisonbg/jupyter-ai/blob/54b965a9222b0dc4aea42b503b69219b966b0504/packages/jupyter-ai/jupyter_ai/document_loaders/directory.py#L47) that defines the file extensions as follows:\n",

    "Therefore, at this time, Jupyter AI can learn from code written in Python, R, Julia, JavaScript and TypeScript, and from documents written in Markdown or Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, you cannot learn from PDF files and pure text files, at this time. If you have PDF documents that you want to analyze, you will need to work outside of Jupyter, for now. One good option is [Claude](https://claude.ai/chat/) by Anthropic, which lets you upload substantial documents in many formats."

    "# Comparison with Claude\n",
    "\n",
    "We made a PDF version of Module 2 available publicly [on Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5673499.v1). Uploading this document to [Claude](https://claude.ai/chat/) and asking the first question above gave the following response:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote><small>\n",
    "Based on the description, it sounds like the key pandas feature needed to make a bubble chart of the beer data set grouped by style is the groupby() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons mention using groupby() to group the beer data by style, and then calculate the mean abv and ibu values within each style group. To make a bubble chart with bubbles representing each style, we would need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Group the beer dataframe by the 'style' column using groupby():\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "beers_by_style = beers.groupby('style')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean abv and ibu for each style group:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "style_means = beers_by_style.mean()[['abv', 'ibu']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extract the style count into a separate series:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "style_counts = beers['style'].value_counts()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use style_means as the x and y data for the bubbles, with style_counts used to set the size of each bubble.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the key pandas feature needed here is groupby(), which allows us to split the dataframe into groups, apply aggregations like mean(), and then use the grouped data to create the desired bubble chart visualization. The groupby() method is essential for handling the grouping of the data needed for this chart.\n",
    "</small></blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "This explanation is not only more detailed than what Open AI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` gave, but it actually solves the problem slightly differently than in the lesson. Instead of first dropping columns we didn't want, and then grouping, Claude's response applied `groupby()` and then extracted the relevant columns by their labels. A student here would get the benefit of an alternative code solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we didn't try `gpt-4`, which we can expect to give better results than `gpt-3.5`."

    "<blockquote><small>\n",
    "    Good catch! When we dropped the unnecessary columns from the dataframe and only kept 'abv', 'ibu' and 'style', it seems we lost some rows that had null values in the 'abv' and 'ibu' columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the number of unique styles went down from 99 to 90 is likely because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Originally, when we extracted the 'style' column and got the value counts, there were 99 unique beer styles represented across all 2410 rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "- But then when we dropped rows with null 'abv' and 'ibu' values, this removed any rows where a style had missing abv or ibu data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- So any styles that only had rows with missing abv/ibu data got removed entirely when we cleaned the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This resulted in only 90 remaining styles that had at least one row with non-null abv and ibu values.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original dataframe had 99 unique styles \n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaning dropped rows with missing abv/ibu data\n",
